Tsukihitei
Hidden deep in the primeval forest behind Kasugataisha Shrine, this venerable ryokan was established in 1903 as a guesthouse
for Nara’s governor. It has since hosted members of the Imperial Family and other dignitaries and is known for its high
quality kaiseki cuisine. There are just three suite-style Japanese rooms, each self-contained and connected to the main
building by a covered walkway for privacy. Although the atmosphere is very traditional, all rooms come with air conditioning
and free Wi-Fi. Being in the forest and yet close to all the sights of Nara is the best of both worlds, and don’t be
surprised if you meet some friendly deer in the front garden.


Edosan
Right in Nara Park, you can expect to be greeted by deer as you stroll around the grounds of this historic ryokan, where
each room is like a private forest retreat. Although the staff speak little English, they welcome guests from around the
world and they have printed information in English. At night, you can sometimes hear the deer calling.


Asukaso
One of the key features of this traditional inn is the rooftop bath, with a view of the Kohfukuji Temple pagoda. There
is a choice of Japanese or Western style rooms, decorated in an updated version of machiya style. Some of the larger
rooms have a round window that perfectly frames a view of the pagoda. They also have worship facilities for Muslim guests.
